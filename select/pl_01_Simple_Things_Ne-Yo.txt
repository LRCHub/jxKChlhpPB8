You put on that makeup,
spend an hour on your hair
High heels and that red
dress with a slit right up
to there and I don't mind
But sweats, a ponytail,
and smile suit me just fine
You'll get in the kitchen,
make a meal fit for a king
Burn your hands and cut
your fingers just to feed me,
girl, and I appreciate
But I'd equally
praise a sandwich that you made
You can search your whole
life never to find
What's standing right in
front of you
It's always the simple things,
the way you laugh
It's the way you cry to
your favorite song
Life is all the in-betweens
The flowers you find on
the uphill climb that keep
you movin' on
And after you stop chasing
Is when you find out all
that really made sense
Is the simple things
It's always the simple things
Head up in the clouds,
so many nights out on the road
To come to the conclusion
that there ain't no place
like home
I took some pretty pictures,
and I made some memories
But there's one truth that
still amazes me
It's always the simple things,
the way you laugh
It's the way you cry to
your favorite song
Life is all the in-betweens
The flowers you find on
the uphill climb that keep
you movin' on
And after you stop chasing
Is when you find out all
that really made sense
It's the little things,
and the big dreams
All the unseens looking back
at me
It's the long talks,
and the quiet drives
And the slow walks,
that's when you realize
It's always the simple things
Always the simple things
It's always the simple things,
the way you laugh
It's the way you cry to
your favorite song
Life is all the in-betweens
The flowers you find on
the uphill climb that keep
you movin' on
And after you stop chasing
Is when you find out all
that really made sense
Is the simple things
It's always the simple things
Oh-oh
It's always the simple things,
yeah
