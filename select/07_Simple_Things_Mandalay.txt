It was the simple things that always
Made her mad
It was the life she lived that always
Made her sad
They couldn't understand the way it felt to her
Girl, you'd better get your act together
Don't close your eyes, they won't wait forever

She waited all her life just to impress them all
She wanted more to life than just this little world
They couldn't break the spell for this little girl
They say when one door closes then another one opens -
A little light will shine when you don't know it

Chorus
I've been waiting for an eternity
For a life that's not nine to five
Oh save me, oh save me

It was the little things
That always meant the most
It was the life they bring
That always let her know
That she got what she got, it was her destiny
Girl, you'd better get your act together
Don't close your eyes they won't wait forever

She gave it all for it,
But still it didn't show
She gave up everything,
But they will never know
They told her try again
Or the dream will end
They said your one step closer
To the big time baby
Not a sealed deal,
They're still saying maybe

Chorus

She gave it all for it, but still it didn't show
She gave up everything, but they will never know
She gave it all for it, but still it didn't show
She gave up everything, but they will never know

Chorus
