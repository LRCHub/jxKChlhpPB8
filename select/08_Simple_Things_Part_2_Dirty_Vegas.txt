Yes I've run a mile in my head
Didn't listen to the things that you said
But it's the simple things that make you smile
It's the simple things that make you smile
[Chorus]
So what went wrong?
Was it me that let you down again?
So what went wrong?
How could I ever lose my best friend?
Cause I've climbed these walls to clear my head
Thought I was something more but I'm a fool instead
But it's the simple things that make you smile
It's the simple things that make you smile
[Chorus]
So what went wrong?
Was it me that let you down again?
So what went wrong?
How could I ever lose my best friend?
[Repeat: x2]
But it's the simple things
It's the simple things that make you smile
It's the simple things
It's the simple things that make you smile
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone
Hey teacher leave them kids alone
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
In the wall
